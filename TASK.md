# Homework Assignment: Understanding the DAO Pattern in Java

## Lecture 18: Homework Overview
As part of Lecture 18 on "Understanding the DAO Pattern in Java," your assignment involves implementing a Java application using the Data Access Object (DAO) pattern. This task will help reinforce your understanding of how to effectively use the DAO pattern in real-world Java applications.

### Objective:
Create a Java application that demonstrates the use of the DAO pattern for database operations. This application should showcase how to manage database interactions in a scalable, maintainable way.

### Task Requirements:
1. **Implement a DAO Interface**: Define a DAO interface with standard CRUD operations.
2. **Create a DAO Implementation**: Develop a concrete class that implements your DAO interface using JDBC.
3. **Model/Data Transfer Object**: Define a model class that your DAO will manage.
4. **Main Application**: Write a main class that uses your DAO implementation for database operations.

### Expected Outcomes:
- A clear understanding of the DAO pattern.
- A Java application that uses DAOs for database interactions.
- Demonstration of CRUD operations in your application.

### Submission Guidelines:
- Submit all your Java source files.
- Include a README file detailing how to run your application and any setup required.
- Document your code appropriately for clarity.

## Evaluation Criteria:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on code quality, correctness of DAO implementation, and how effectively you use the DAO pattern for database interactions. Good luck!
